# FindMissingOddNumber 
Find missing number in the array
Assume that we have an array of possible integers from m to n which includes all odd numbers from m to n except one. There is always a single missing number and array is not sorted ascending or descending

Example:
* Input   :  [17, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 1]
* Output  :  11

 
- Input   : [9,5,3] 
- Output  : 7
